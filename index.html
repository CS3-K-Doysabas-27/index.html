		<h1>Fall</h1>
		<h3>by Kennisha Samantha Doysabas</h3>
		<br>
		<h2>Plucked strings thick and thin</h2>
		<h2>A beautiful melody is played by the wind</h2>
		<h2>Autumn leaves falling down</h2>
		<h2>Loved each fall for its song</h2>
		<br>
		<h2>As I sat and watched the fall</h2>
		<h2>Any song comes like a spell</h2>
		<h2>But this isn't just any spell</h2>
		<h2>It's the skill of plucking each cord</h2>
